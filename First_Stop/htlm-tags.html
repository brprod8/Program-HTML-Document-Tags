  <p>On July 16, 1969, the Apollo 11 spacecraft launched from the Kennedy Space Center in Florida. Its mission was to
    go
    where no human being had gone before—the moon! The crew consisted of Neil Armstrong, Michael Collins, and Buzz
    Aldrin. The spacecraft landed on the moon in the Sea of Tranquility, a basaltic flood plain, on July 20, 1969.
    The
    moonwalk took place the following day. On July 21, 1969, at precisely 10:56 EDT, Commander Neil Armstrong
    emerged
    from the Lunar Module and took his famous first step onto the moon’s surface. He declared, “That’s one small
    step
    for man, one giant leap for mankind.” It was a monumental moment in human history!</p>
